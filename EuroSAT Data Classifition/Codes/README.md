# EuroSAT Classification with RGB and NIR Bands

## Description
This project aims to classify EuroSAT satellite images using four specific bands: RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and NIR (Near-Infrared). The workflow involves:

1. **Calculating Spectral Indices**: Various spectral indices are derived from the RGB and NIR bands.
2. **Creating Masks**: Threshold-based masks are generated based on the calculated indices.
3. **Feature Extraction**: The area of these masks is computed and used as features for classification.
4. **Classification**: The extracted features are fed into a Random Forest classifier, achieving an accuracy of **0.85**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eurosat-classification.git
   cd eurosat-classification
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Manual Installation** (if you don't use `requirements.txt`):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn opencv-python
   ```

## Usage

### File Descriptions

- **`indices.py`**: Processes the input satellite data to calculate various spectral indices, creates masks based on predefined thresholds, and converts the resulting data into a CSV file.

- **`join.py`**: Combines the CSV files generated by `indices.py` for further analysis.

- **`concrete.py`**: Allows for setting custom thresholds specifically for generating a concrete mask.

- **`Random_Forest.py`**: The main script used for training the Random Forest classifier and performing the classification, achieving an accuracy of **0.85**.

### Running the Code

1. **Preprocess Data**:
   ```bash
   python indices.py
   ```

2. **Join Feature Files**:
   ```bash
   python join.py
   ```

3. **Set Custom Thresholds (optional)**:
   ```bash
   python concrete.py
   ```

4. **Train and Classify**:
   ```bash
   python Random_Forest.py
   ```

## Results
- The Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of **0.85** on the EuroSAT dataset using the extracted features.
